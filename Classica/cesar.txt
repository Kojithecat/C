preface

this short history of the world is meant to be read
straightforwardly almost as a novel is read.  it gives in the most
general way an account of our present knowledge of history, shorn
of elaborations and complications.  it has been amply illustrated
and everything has been done to make it vivid and clear.  from it
the reader should be able to get that general view of history
which is so necessary a framework for the study of it particular
period or the history of a particular country.  it may be found
useful as a preparatory excursion before the reading of the
author's much fuller and more explicit _outline of history_ is
undertaken.  but its especial end is to meet the needs of the busy
general reader, too driven to study the maps and time charts of
that _outline_ in detail, who wishes to refresh and repair his
faded or fragmentary conceptions of the great adventure of
mankind.  it is not an abstract or condensation of that former
work.  within its aim the _outline_ admits of no further
condensation.  this is a much more generalized history, planned
and written afresh.
